# Effective Functional Programming Language

In the last blog,
I go through the only requirement to write functional programming code: the ability to write pure function.

It is not a very useful requirement as you can write pure functions in any programming language.

In this blog, I'll go through language features that make writing functional programming easier.

The first feature is function as a first-class citizen.

This is very obvious because if the language does not support function as first-class citizen,
the programmers have to wrap the function inside an object or an instance of a class.

Again it is doable, but allowing programmers to pass functions around directly makes the code much easier to write.
