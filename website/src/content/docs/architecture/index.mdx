There are many ways to write code.

Architecture is about how to structure our code.

You can structure the code to be maintainable,
you can structure the code to be fast,
you can structure the code to be scalable,
you can structure the code to be testable,
you can structure the code to be reusable.

Knowing what you want to choose the right approach is architecture.
