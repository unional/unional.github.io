# Semantic Versioning

Semantic versioning has become a very important cornerstone of software development.
It adds well-defined meanings to the otherwise arbitrary, marketing driven version of 1.0, 1.1, 2.0 etc.

I have been using `semantic-release` and it definitely makes my life much easier in managing the 30+ packages that I have.

But on the other hand, it does have its share of flaws in the current workflow and this article will describe these flaws as well as the solution I have in getting the best out of it.

To begin, let's take a quick review of what is Semantic Versioning:

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes.

In a nutshell, `semantic-release` helps you manage your package's version by:

1. Analyze the commits you have made, looking for a specific format, to determine the appropriate version bump.
2. Update the version for you and publish the package automatically.

‚ùì How about?

- unstable
- dist-tag + unstable is the solution.
