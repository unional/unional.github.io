There are a few types of keys:

- in-the-flow keys: those that you type continuously on the keyboard.
- incidental keys: those that you use when the flow are broken. e.g. backspace, tab, delete, insert
- navigation keys
- modifier keys
- management keys: switch between layers
- other keys: macros, media
